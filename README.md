# Hi there, I'm **Beki**, 👋

I'm a cloud and DevOps engineer from Ethiopia who enjoys learning and building cool things in the cloud. I thrive on deep learning and understanding not just how things work, but why they matter—exploring the impact of technologies and the importance of different perspectives.

With a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**, I have a solid foundation in technology, and my current focus is **cloud computing**. I'm particularly fascinated by **serverless architectures** and their potential to enhance cost and performance efficiency.

I'm actively enhancing my cloud expertise and seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world environments. Open to collaborations, hands-on projects, and learning experiences in cloud engineering.
## 🔥 What I Do
- 🚀 **Cloud Solutions:** Designing and deploying cloud-native applications using AWS.
- 🏗 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automating deployments with Terraform and AWS CDK.
- 📡 **DevOps & CI/CD:** Implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and AWS services.
